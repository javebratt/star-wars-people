# Star Wars People

Demo app showing basic information from Star Wars Characters using [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/).

The idea is to showcase new Angular 16 features such as:

- Standalone components.
- Dependency injection without `constructor() {}` using `inject()` instead.
- Self-closing tags for custom components.
- Mark component inputs as required.
- New `takeUntilDestroyed()` operator to destroy subscriptions in the component's onDestroy lifecycle hook.
- Turning on server-side rendering and hydration.
